# precise_schedule

FLOSS Web Schedule Application

## The Original Project

In 2018, I developed a Java schedule application named PreciseSchedule. Back then, I lacked
knowledge about clean code, clean architecture, data structures, and testing. Shortly after
completing the application, I had the urge to rewrite it, applying the knowledge gained.

## The Rewritings

### 2021

- Finished most of the frontend using **React**
- Made the backend using **NestJS**

### 2023

- Finished the frontend using **NextJS**, and made it work standalone from the backend
- Applyed **DDD** to create a new backend in **Deno** from the scratch

### 2024

- I rewrote the **Deno** backend using the structured paradigm and the **Result** data structure
  inspired on **Rust**

## The Lessons

Through the process, I learned:

- To shrink the features to their essentials
- To start development by core functionality
- That the architecture is more important than the code
